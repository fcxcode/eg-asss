There should be a way to create out-of-process extensions to asss.

This is desirable because certain extensions might interfere with the
functioning of the main process, even if they are in a separate thread.
For example, adding extension languages that require garbage collection,
or interfere with memory allocation in some other way.

Note: This out-of-process extension mechanism is not intended to be
available to the public for general consumption. It is intended to
enable things like scheme or python interpreters. Extensions to the
server should then be written in scheme or python or whatever.

----------

Possible choices for the IPC between asss and these extensions are:
 * shared memory
   not great, because the whole reason we want them to be out-of-process
   is because of memory
 * unix named pipes
 * unix sockets
 * tcp sockets

To minimize unix-dependance, tcp sockets sound best.

There needs to be a protocol for communication over these sockets.

Requirements for the protocol:
 * bidirectional
   asss must send data for processing to the extension server, and the
   server must send commands back to asss to be processed.
 * simple
   there's no reason to spend a lot of time on this
 * extensible
   this should work for more than just scheme
 * indifferent
   using s-expressions would be nice, but places too many requirements
   on both sides.

Proposal 1:

Data will be sent across the socket in both directions.

The data will look like:
struct Data
{
    unsigned int size;
    unsigned int type;
    byte data[size];
}

The format of the 'data' member, of course, is dependant on the type.

Types of communication are #defined with names following the format:

A2E_TYPE1 - for messages from asss to the extension
E2A_TYPE2 - for messages from the extension to asss

----------

Example layout of scheme interpreter extension:


Examples of use:

Player types "?scmraw (+ 1 1)"
Server responds "Scheme: 2"

Player types:
?scm (lambda (pid arena)
       (foreach (lambda (pid)
                        (send-message pid
                                      (string-append "Hello, "
                                                     (player-name pid))))
                (get-arena-players arena))
Server responds: "Scheme: #<void>"
and server also sends "Hello, <player>" to everyone in the arena that
player is in.


Observations on above examples:

The extension server will have to make requests of the server for
several things. First of all, send-message will have to send a
(out-of-process protocol) message to asss to accomplish its function. It
can do this and return immediately, since it will probably return
#<void>. However, player-name and get-all-players cannot return
immediately. They must send a message to asss and wait for a response.
This suggests the following models:

* threaded model:
The scheme server will be multi-threaded.
Evaluations will be associated with sessions.
Sessions may block.
Each session will run in a separate thread, so that they don't interrupt
one another.
Messages to the server for requests for information will carry an
identifier, so the network layer of the scheme server can send them to
the right thread.

problems: how to make threads sleep, wake up at right times, and how to
idenfify them.

* sequential model:
Evaluations will be strictly sequential.
The server will maintain a queue of expressions to evaluate, as well as
queues for all messsage types.
When the extension executes a function that requires a response from
asss, it will call a C function that will run the recv loop, and return
the next message of the correct type to its caller. It will queue all
other messages in the global type queues. (If there are messages of the
requested type in a queue, it will return the first of those.)

problems: can't execute in parallel. out of order problems?

* continuation model:
Scheme functions that require responses from the server will be defined
in a manner similar to this:
(define (player-name pid)
  (call/cc
    (lambda (cont)
      (register-player-name-waiter cont pid)
      (kill-this-evaluation))))
That is, they will register their continuation with the network layer so
that it can be called when a message of the correct type comes in, and
then they will somehow stop the evaluation of their caller, to wait
until that message does come.

problems: how the hell do you (kill-this-evaluation)? plus, this deals
with continuations, which are quite confusing.


Conclusions:

The sequential model seems like the best way to go for now. As long as
the server doesn't send request-response messages when it's not supposed
to, things should work fine. To make sure of that condition, maybe we
really should have only one message type queued, the strings to eval,
because that's the only one we expect without a specific request.



Message types:

A2E_EVALSTRING - tells the extension to evaluate a string and apply it
  to the calling pid and arena - no response (technically not, but the
  scheme daemon will generate an E2A_SENDMESSAGE)
#define MAXPARAMS 15
struct EvalStringData /* variable length */
{
	/* where to send the result. -1 for code generated by the server */
	int callingpid;
	/* how many parameters. -1 to not apply it at all */
	int paramcount;
	int param[MAXPARAMS];
    char string[];
}

E2A_SENDMESSAGE - sends an arena message to a player - no response
struct SendMessageData /* variable length */
{
    int pid;
    char message[];
}

E2A_GETPLAYERDATA - retrieves the player name - wants response
struct GetPlayerNameData
{
    int pid;
}

A2E_PLAYERDATA - response to GETPLAYERNAME - no response
struct PlayerDataData
{
    int pid;
    PlayerData pd;
}

E2A_GETPLAYERLIST - get lists of pids - wants response
struct GetPlayerListData
{
    int arena; /* -1 = all arenas, else = specific arena */
    int freq; /* -1 = all freqs, else = specific freq */
    int shiptype; /* -1 = all shiptypes, else = specific ones */
}

A2E_PLAYERLIST - returns lists of pids - no response
struct PlayerListData /* variable length */
{
    int pid[]; /* terminated by a -1 */
}

E2A_SETSETTING - changes a dynamic setting - no response
struct SetSettingData
{
    int arena; /* -1 = global, else = specific arena */
    char section[MAXNAMELEN];
    char key[MAXKEYLEN];
    char data[MAXVALUELEN];
}

E2A_GETSETTING - gets the value of a setting - wants response
struct GetSettingData
{
    int arena; /* -1 = global, else = specific arena */
}


A2E_SETTING - the value of a setting - no response
struct SettingData /* variable length */
{
    char data[];
}

E2A_INSTALLPERIODIC - install a periodic callback - no response
struct InstallPeriodicData /* variable length */
{
    int seconds;
    char string[];
}

E2A_SETSHIP - set someones ship - no response
struct SetShipData
{
    int pid;
    int shiptype;
    int lock; /* boolean - lock them there? */
}




How to handle some circumstances:

dynamic settings:

we want to run a certain snippet every 5 minutes.

(define (dyn-freq-maxplayers pid-unused arena)
  (set-setting arena
               "Freq"
               "MaxPlayers"
               (let ((cnt (length (get-arena-nonspec-players arena))))
                 (if (< cnt 10) 4
                 (if (< cnt 20) 7
                 (if (< cnt 30) 10
                                15)))
               ))

solution: have an ArenaAction handler install a timer function. the
timer function calls scheme->EvalString() on the code.

better solution: let each arena have a scheme file associated with it.
the scheme file is loaded and evaluated from the scheme asss module in
an ArenaAction handler. it may call certain functions that will install
handlers for certain things.

example:

(define (dyn-freq-maxplayers pid-unused arena)
  ...)

;; dyn-freq-maxplayers will be evaluated and applied to a pid and arena
;; every 5 minutes
(install-periodic (* 5 60) "dyn-freq-maxplayers")

note that the thing to call is specified as a string. that is necessary
because it will be sent back to the extension server through an
EvalString message (not raw).

when the arena is reaped, the ArenaAction for the scheme module will
remove all of the callbacks associated with that arena. they will remain
in the scheme global environment, though. they will be redefined the
next time the arena is loaded, so this approach shouldn't leak memory,
though it will never release it.


a simple elimbot:

FIXME: write elimbot in scheme


----------

interface to players:

first, evaluating expressions will be limited to staff. it might be
possible to allow everyone to use a limited interpreter, one without any
of the things that will call back to the server.

the following commands should be available:
?scm - evaluates an expression and applies it to the pid and arena
?scmraw - evaluates and expression and calls SendMessage on the result
          to send it back to the player
?scmstart - from that command, everything the player types in pub
            chat will be concatenated into a string and sent to the
            interpreter, until the player types a single period on a
            line.

using ?scmstart and intelligent use of callbacks, it should be possible
to program a bot from within the client.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok, we have a working elderd/scheme module. now we need to update it to
handle all kinds of new events, plus another language.

more thinking first:

do we want one process per zone or one per arena?
	one/arena means arenas have less chance to corrupt each other's
	code/data. but it means more memory. (really?)

how to handle custom code per-arena?
	send the extension an arena-creation event, which will then load
	code from a file based on the arena name.
	all code will be loaded dynamically, nothing compiled (at least not
	yet).

what has to get sent from asss to ext?
	it's good to handle registration of events within the extension.
	that way, asss can send the extension a single event, and it'll be
	multiplexed to various handlers.

how to handle multiple langages:
	obviously, we don't want asss generating lines of code to interpret,
	because we want it to all go through the same module. thus, asss
	must send only structs, or maybe ascii?! the extension module will
	then printf the code into a string and then run it.


...

which of these do we want sent to our external module?

CB_ARENAACTION		*		(int arena, int action)
CB_BALLPICKUP		yes		(int arena, int pid, int bid)
CB_BALLFIRE			yes		(int arena, int pid, int bid)
CB_GOAL				yes!	(int arena, int pid, int bid, int x, int y)
CB_PLAYERACTION		yes		(int pid, int action, int arena)
CB_FLAGPICKUP		yes		(int arena, int pid, int fid, int oldfreq)
CB_FLAGDROP			yes		(int arena, int pid)
CB_FLAGPOS			yes		(int arena, int pid, int fid, int oldfreq)
CB_FLAGWIN			yes		(int arena, int freq)
CB_KILL				yes		(int arena, int killer, int killed, int bounty, int flags)
CB_FREQCHANGE		yes		(int pid, int newfreq)
CB_SHIPCHANGE		yes		(int pid, int newship, int newfreq)
CB_LOGFUNC			no?
CB_MAINLOOP			no?

* if we're going to do one process/arena, then this can be handled
  separately. 

notice that all the parameters are ints, and the maximum number is 5.

how about we say this?
struct a2e_event
{
	char evname[32];
	int params[10];
};

that'll make 72 bytes. can we do better?

yes: ascii
"%s[:%d]*\n"

advantages:
eol delimiter elimintates the need for passing message sizes.
can write the whole python extension in python!
and scheme too!

how do we do the rest in ascii?

A2E_NULL			"null"
A2E_SHUTDOWN		"shutdown"
A2E_EVALSTRING		"eval:%s" (the string)
A2E_PLAYERDATA		"pd:<lotsafields>"
A2E_PLAYERLIST		"plist[:%d]*" (pids)
A2E_SETTING			"set:%s" (the setting)

A2E_EVENT			"event:%s[:%d]*" (type, params*)

E2A_NULL			"null"
E2A_SHUTTINGDOWN	"shuttingdown"
E2A_SENDMESSAGE		"sendmsg:%d:%s"
E2A_GETPLAYERDATA	"getpd:%d"
E2A_GETPLAYERLIST	"getplist:%d:%d:%d" (arena/-1, freq, ship)
E2A_FINDPLAYER		"findplayer:%s"
E2A_GETSETTING		"getcfg:%d:%s:%s" (arena/-1, sec, key)
E2A_SETSETTING		"setcfg:%d:%s:%s:%s" (arena/-1, sec, key, val)
E2A_RUNCOMMAND		"cmd:%d:%s" (target, cmd)

what more x2x messages do we need?

a2e: event should take care of everything except requests for info
e2a: need funcs for just about every interface function!

is there a way to make that easier?
we could use a standard, like:
"%s:%s[:%x]*" (module name, C function name, parameters)

that would work for most, but not for things where you pass in C
function pointers, e.g. commands. have to deal with those specially:

how to allow extension to define commands?

e2a: "regcmd:%s" / "unregcmd:%s"  (cmd name)
a2e: "cmd:%s:%s" (cmd, params)

this requires allowing C command funcs to see their own command
(probably a good idea anyway).

any more things that aren't handled by the callback mechanism?
packets. but we don't want extensions to deal with those.

summary:

callbacks in c turn into a2e "event:..."
interfaces in c turn into e2a "module:CFunction:..."
(with special handling for pointers to things (e.g. ConfigHandle))
data (players, arenas, flags, balls) turns into call/return:

e2a: "getcdata:%s:%d" (name of array, index)
a2e: "cdata:%s:%d[:%x]*" (name of array, index, data*)

also make special cases for things like getting lists of players,
getting one player's name, etc. possibly cache some data on the
extension-side.

so, for what of this does ordering of messages matter?

only getcdata/cdata, it seems.

so, extension must maintain queue of stuff to process. when it sends a
getcdata, it waits for the cdata, queueing anything else it gets.

or: use 2nd (oob) channel?

advantages: os handles holding our incoming events while we wait on
returned data.
disadvantages: makes writing stuff harder. how do we manage it with
sockets? the extension server will fork on incoming connection, and then
we need a 2nd connection to be established. extension will need to bind
to random port, send the port number to asss, and wait for another
connection.

conclusion: let's just buffer the damned stuff ourselves.

--------------------

back to configuration for a bit:
arenas should be able to use more than one oop extension at once.
we also want to auto-configure between unix sockets and tcp sockets.
so: each oop module (there should be one for each language) gets a
number.

8313 (scm)

the config file will have:
[General]
ExternalModules = scheme python

the oop module will have a table between those strings and designated
port numbers (perhaps start them from 8313 and increase by one?).
it will first try to connect to /tmp/asss/extension-%s, and if it fails,
just try connecting to the tcp socket.
