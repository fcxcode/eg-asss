	<h2>how to get the asss source code</h2>

	<h6><a name="warning">warning</h6>

	<p>
	First, if you just want to run asss, you should download a release
	from the <a href="/asss/">main page</a>, which includes pre-built
	binaries for either Linux or Windows.
	</p>

	<p>
	Second, you should be somewhat familiar with build tools like
	compilers and the <tt>make</tt> program, version control systems,
	and the basics of cryptography. Otherwise this might get confusing.

	I'm using <a href="http://venge.net/monotone/">monotone</a> as the
	version control system for the asss source code. You should first
	visit their <a href="http://venge.net/monotone/docs/">documentation
	site</a> and read the Concepts and Tutorial sections. Then download
	a copy of monotone (version 0.24 is recommended) and try playing
	around with it for a while. Then <a href="#asss">skip down to</a>
	the information you need to get the asss source.
	</p>

	<p>
	Since I know you're probably not going to read all that, though,
	I'll quickly sketch the basics of monotone here:
	</p>

	<p>
	Monotone is a decentralized version control system. Each user
	maintains a <i>database</i> on their own computer, which contains a
	big bag of files and other information. Users can connect to each
	other and swap files and other information. There is no "central
	server" which has the authoritative copy of anything; instead each
	user has his or her own view of the world, and they can sync up as
	often as they want.
	</p>

	<p>
	There are two types of things stored in the database: <i>files</i>,
	and <i>revisions</i> (this is an inaccurate simplification, but
	enough for our purpose). A file is a snapshot of a file on disk at
	some point in time, and a revision is a snapshot of a directory
	tree, which is list of files with their names and locations.
	Revisions also contain information about history (which revision
	they came from, etc.). Files and revisions are identified by their
	cryptographic hashes.
	</p>

	<p>
	A revision exists on a <i>branch</i>, which is a set of revisions
	that conceptually belong to the same project, or sometimes a major
	fork of development on a project.
	</p>

	<p>
	The basic workflow when using monotone is: A user <i>checks out</i>
	the latest revision (a) on some branch, makes some changes to their
	files, and <i>commits</i> them to their database, creating a new
	revision (b). Then they <i>push</i> that new revision, along with
	the files contained in it, to some remote database. Or maybe another
	user <i>pulls</i> the new revision from their database. Either way,
	the second user now has a new revision in their database. Their
	working copy was based on revision a, so they have to <i>update</i>
	their working copy to b, and when they do, they'll see the changes
	that the first user made. Update brings changes from the database
	into the working copy.
	</p>

	<p>
	Things get more complicated when two users both make changes at
	once. Let's say user one creates revision b, based on a, and at the
	same time, user two creates c, also based on a. When the two users
	<i>sync</i>, they'll both have each other's new revisions, but they
	won't be able to update, because the branch has two <i>heads</i>.
	At least one of them will have to <i>merge</i> the two heads back
	into one, and then exchange that new revision with the other one. To
	actually see the results of the merge in their working copy they'll
	have to update it to the new revision. Merges operate on the
	database only, and create a new revision based on two existing ones.
	</p>

	<p>
	I have a dedicated monotone server for asss-related code. It's just
	on a cable modem connection, so it's not very fast, and it might be
	down sometimes. You should connect to <b>asss.yi.org</b> on the
	standard monotone port (5253).
	</p>

	<p>Available branches:
	<dl>
		<dt><tt>asss.asss.main</tt></dt>
		<dd>The asss code itself. This is probably what you want.</dd>
		<dt><tt>asss.adminsh</tt></dt>
		<dd>A system for running a server containing multiple
		independently-administered asss zones.</dd>
		<dt><tt>asss.aswz</tt></dt>
		<dd>A couple of in-progress modules for ASWZ.</dd>
		<dt><tt>asss.plog</tt></dt>
		<dd>Simple packet-logging code.</dd>
		<dt><tt>asss.bsss</tt></dt>
		<dd>A half-complete billing server written in Erlang. Abandoned.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
	The quickest possible way to get the code, after downloading a
	montone binary, would be:
	</p>

<pre>
monotone -d asss.db db init
monotone -d asss.db pull asss.yi.org asss.asss.main
monotone -d asss.db -b asss.asss.main checkout asss
</pre>

	<p>
	Note that the pull command can take a very long time. It will
	eventually finish, just leave it alone for a while.
	</p>

	<p>
	Later, to update that working directory to the latest version, from
	within the working directory:
	</p>

<pre>
monotone pull
monotone update
</pre>

	<p>
	If you'd like commit access to the public server, please ask.
	Monotone doesn't currently support fine-grained write access
	control, so this requires a little bit of trust, but I'm willing to
	do it nevertheless. You'll have to give me your monotone public key
	(run <tt>monotone pubkey <i>keyid</i></tt>).
	</p>
