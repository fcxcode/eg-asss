	<h2>a small subspace server</h2>

	<p>
	asss is a server for the game <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">subspace</a>.
	It has lots more features than the current server in use. It is
	primarily developed on Linux, but also runs on other unix-like
	systems, and at times, Windows.

		<li>January 14, 2006 - 1.4.2. Sorry for the long wait. The bug
		tracker has been working well and almost all of the changes
		since the last version have been based on bugs listed there.
		There are too many small changes to list here; see the changelog
		for details. One important change to note is how interfaces and
		persistent data are implemented in python. If you use
		<code>reg_interface</code>, <code>reg_player_persistent</code>,
		or <code>reg_arena_persistent</code>, you'll have to change your
		code. Oh, and the <code>bricklayer</code> module was renamed to
		<code>brickwriter</code>, so if you load it, you'll have to
		update your <code>modules.conf</code>.

		<li>October 15, 2005 - 1.4.1. New version with a bunch of
		accumulated bug fixes, and a few new modules: redirect and
		obscene.

		<li>October 10, 2005. Still no new version, but I've written
		some instructions for getting access to the latest version of
		the <a href="source.html">asss source</a> using monotone.

		<li>September 16, 2005. No new version, but now there's a
		<a href="bugs">bug tracker</a> available.

		<li>June 3, 2005. There's a new build of 1.4.0 for windows, to
		fix a building bug that I really should have caught earlier.
		Hopefully this is the last of the build-related problems. Use
		the link for "1.4.0 (windows full)" below.

		<li>May 14, 2005 - 1.4.0. There isn't really any new big
		features here, but it's been a while, and there was some
		significant reorganization of the source code directory
		structure and build process, so I figured it deserved a jump in
		version numbers. Here's a brief summary of all the new stuff
		since January:

		<p>
		<a href="userguide.html">User guide</a> updates, fixed no-flags
		region attribute, improved ap_multipub placing, per-player
		settings overrides, support for non-whole-byte settings
		overrides, fixed various bugs (position-based speccing, a
		crashing race condition, map checksums, deadlocks related to
		setting ship/freq), tweaked the syntax for multi-commands
		slightly, rewrite of bandwidth limiting stuff, switched version
		control from cvs to <a href="http://venge.net/monotone/">monotone</a>
		(instructions coming soon), reorganized source directory
		structure and cleaned up makefiles and build process, and a slew
		of <a href="ccc">ccc</a> features (automkwin, "all" window,
		auto-reconnect, and ?ignore).

		<li>January 29, 2005 - 1.3.6. This is mostly bug fixes for all
		the new flag stuff in 1.3.5.

		<li>January 8, 2005 - 1.3.5. Sorry it's been so long. This
		update has a bunch of new features and myriad bug fixes. The
		biggest ones are probably the brand-new flag code, and
		improvements to the python support. This version has also been
		built for windows (still using Dev-C++).

		<li>September 13, 2004 - 1.3.2: The windows build with VC
		Toolkit wasn't working out, so I switched to mingw32 and the <a
			href="http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/">Dev-C++ IDE</a>. This
		release contains almost everything you'll need to build asss on
		windows. You just need to download Dev-C++ and
		<a href="http://python.org/2.3.4/">Python 2.3.4</a>. On the
		Linux side, you still need to track down the dependencies on
		your own.

		<br>Besides the build, the only other notable new feature here
		is support for Continuum 0.39pr1. I wasn't planning to do this
		yet, but enough people were complaining that I changed my mind.
		Enjoy.

		<li>September 6, 2004 - 1.3.1: This is a development release
		that contains some new stuff, like support for extended lvl
		files. Currently the only program that can create extended lvl
		files is lvltool, available below (I'll merge it into the main
		package soon). Note that a lot of interfaces have changed, so
		you'll probably need to recompile your modules.

		<br>Also, there's now a windows build. I'm not sure if it's
		presented in the most useful way, so if you have suggestions,
		I'd like to hear them.

		<li>July 28, 2004: Yay, 1.2.0! I just recently got back from
		being away from computers and subspace for a while, so I forgot
		what's new in this release, but I figure it's long past due to
		put it up. I've been avoiding making major changes and just
		fixing small bugs lately, so I think it's a good time to label
		this the start of a stable series. I'm going to start a 1.3 line
		with more drastic development soon.

		<li>June 12, 2004: Another update without new code. This one has
		good news, though: To go along with the changelog (which is
		still working and might have more frequent updates than this
		page), there's API documentation, generated by
		<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>.
		The link's at the bottom of the page. It's not beautiful or
		incredibly helpful, but it's better than nothing, and there's
		more coming, I hope.

		<li>April 19, 2004: This is an update without a new release.
		Sorry. I've been busy and haven't time to get to everything I
		want to get to before I label it 1.1.8. One bit of good news is
		that I managed to get a semi-automated changelog generator thing
		working, so there's a link to the CVS changelog at the bottom of
		the page. The other bit is that there are lots of nice bug fixes
		and things since 1.1.7, including (I hope) the (infamous?) lag
		coma bug.

		<li>January 20, 2004 - 1.1.7: There have been a lot of small
		important changes since the last version. Most imporant are
		probably some drastic changes to the network layer that fix
		problems with reliable packets that people had been having, and
		also make reliable processing more efficient. Also fixed a
		frequent deadlock bug, a crash bug, added MaxDeathsWithoutFiring
		support, added a timeout to ?kick, fixed the null squad message
		thing, moved a lot of core modules into the main binary, some
		changes to support compiling with MinGW (so you might expect
		windows binaries from me at some point), added support for a new
		ping protocol, and added ?arena -t.

		<li>November 21, 2003 - 1.1.6: A new release. Lots of fixes, and
		some small new features. Yeah, the version number jumped a bit
		since it's been so long. I'm going to try to get something to
		take my (somewhat) detailed change logs from CVS and post them
		here.

		<li>September 18, 2003 - 1.1.3: Fixed a big bug, added
		?recyclearena, other tiny changes.

		<li>September 10, 2003 - 1.1.2: Sorry it's been so long. This update
		has a lot of bug fixes, a few new or fixed commands, a bunch of
		new ccc features (for all 4 of you who use it), and the
		beginnings of a developer guide.

		<li>July 27, 2003 - 1.1.0: I'm going to start adopting the convention
		that even minor version numbers mean stable releases, and odd
		minor version numbers mean unstable development releases. I
		fixed a few things and have something to call a final 1.0. I've
		also been working on new experimental stuff, and I'm releasing
		that as 1.1.0 now. So if you'd like to try the latest crazy
		stuff, try that. If you want something that might be a little
		more stable, try 1.0 (I did backport a bunch of fixes that I
		made between 1.0rc2 and 1.1.0 to 1.0).

		<li>1.0rc2: Just a few minor fixes here. Probably the most
		important is to the directory module: it now supports multiple
		listening ports and a few bugs were fixed. Also, there are
		binaries for freebsd included this time, plus a little patch to
		help you compile it on your own.

		<li>1.0rc1: This is the first of hopefully few release
		candidates for version 1.0. What's so special about 1.0?
		Nothing, really. It's just a nice round number, and I wanted to
		wait until all the core features were basically complete before
		calling something 1.0. Anyway, please test this and let me know
		about any urgent bugs. I'd like to have 1.0 be something stable
		so I can start adding crazy new features soon.

		<li>Here's 0.9.13: A lot of bugs have been fixed, and there's
		some new stuff. Continuum 0.38 is required to connect to it
		(there's nothing in the code requiring that, it's just that I
		turned on the packet crc check and 0.37 doesn't send correct
		crcs, so it can't connect).
