methods for measuring lag

latency
  round trip delay on rel packets
    pros: accurate
    cons: have to divide by two to get latency

  diff between timestamp on pos packets
    pros: very frequent
    cons: not really acurate

  the same two above, but client measures and reports
    pros: you get more data
    cons: have to trust client

packetloss
  number of times you have to resend rel
    pros:
    cons: doesn't give you the dir of the ploss

  number of dup'd rel packets you get
    pros: it definitely means a dropped ack s2c
    cons: pretty rare, can't get real stats from it

  ask client for number of packets sent/recvd
    pros: very accurate
    cons: have to trust client
