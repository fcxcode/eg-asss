I finally took a few minutes to sit down and take a crack at fixing the
latency settings in the public arena.  The servers latency settings are
more numerous than one might probably imagine.  While this is a good thing
because it allows for a more articulate definition and control of latency,
it also makes the modification of the settings something more of a pain.

The following is my interpretation of what the latency settings do/stand for,
and I made adjustments to them accordingly.  We will see how well my
interpretations live up in the next few weeks of play.

First, a few terms:

Latency 
- The amount of time it takes to send data from one side to another.
There are two types of Latency, server to client (S2C) and client to
server (C2S).  This time is measured in milliseconds (ms).

SlowPacket
- This is the term used to describe a packet that fails the server
defined definition of a packet that is "too" latent, that is, takes
too long to reach its destination.

PacketLoss
- Packetloss is defined as the fraction of packets sent for which there
is no acknowledgment of receipt.  This includes packets that are not
received by the destination as well as acknowledgments that are lost
before returning to the original sender.

The server allows for two basic methods of enforcing latency
restrictions: SlowPacket restrictions, and PacketLoss restrictions.

First, we're going to go over SlowPackets.

The standard server latency settings basically consist of the
definitions of SlowPacket's, both C2S and S2C, and then the
definitions of how long the C2S packets can be SlowPacket's
before doing something about it (namely: Kicking them).
The definition of the C2S SlowPacket is found in the following

Latency:SlowPacketTime

This setting specifies a number of milliseconds, if the packet in
question takes more than that number of milliseconds to go from
the client to the server, then it is to be considered a SlowPacket.
The comprable S2C setting is

Latency:ClientSlowPacketTime

Now that we have defined the C2S and S2C SlowPacket's, we can decide
just how strict we will be with those who's packets violate this
definition.

The definition of this strictness consists of two settings for
each latency type (C2S and S2C).  The first setting is a percentage
which defines the maximum percentage of the packets that can be
SlowPackets before the player is kicked.  The second setting is a
sample size which defines how many packets to sample before
checking for the previously defined percentage.
The C2S setting for the percentage is

Latency:SlowPacketKickoutPercent

and the S2C is

Latency:ClientSlowPacketKickoutPercent

This percentage is defined as a number from 0 to 1000, so
500 would be 50%, 20 would be 2% etc.

The C2S setting for the sample size is

Latency:SlowPacketSampleSize

and the S2C is

Latency:ClientSlowPacketSampleSize


Now lets take a look at how I have the settings in ASWZ public
arena's:


Latency:ClientSlowPacketTime           = 175
Latency:SlowPacketTime                 = 175
Latency:SlowPacketKickoutPercent       = 90
Latency:ClientSlowPacketKickoutPercent = 90
Latency:SlowPacketSampleSize           = 125
Latency:ClientSlowPacketSampleSize     = 125

Lets see what these numbers represent.
As you can see, I defined the C2S latency settings to be
exactly the same as the S2C latency settings.  We can argue
about the legitimacy of this policy later, but it if nothing
else it is convenient for our analysis.

The SlowPacket time is 175.  This means that if it takes
175ms for the packet to go from one side to the other, then
it will be called a SlowPacket.  To get an indication about
how long it takes to go both ways (C2S and S2C), round-trip,
a fairly good indicator (I assume) would be your ping time.
Simply divide your ping time by 2 and, assuming you don't have
one sided latency (a rather large assumption), this should
give you a very general indication of your latency.
Working with the assumption that you have fairly balanced latency
(again a very large assumption) if you have a ping time of 350,
then, according to our assumption, your C2S latency would be 175
and your S2C latency would be another 175 (this is what we ment by
having balanced latency).

The SlowPacketKickoutPercent is set to 90, which corresponds to
9.0%.  The SlowPacketSampleSize is 125.  Put these two settings
together with the first setting and we come to understand that these
settings would establish rules such that:

If in a pool of 125 packets, more than 9.0% (~11 packets) of them take more than
175ms to get to their destination, you will be kicked.

Now that we've pretty thoroughly described how to use SlowPacket
restrictions, the PacketLoss restrictions are much simpler.

The PacketLoss restrictions are basically comprised of 4 settings.
The first setting defines the packetloss percentage C2S before
being kicked.  The second setting does this for S2C.  The third
setting defines the adjustment in this percentage to give to a
player in spectator mode (the idea being that if you are in spec
you are allowed to have more packetloss).  The fourth setting allows
you to disable players weapons for high packetloss 

The first setting is

PacketLoss:C2SKickOutPercent

this setting defines the minimum percent of packets that must get through
in else the player is kicked.  It is in the form used earlier, 0-1000, so
a value of 950 would define a maximum C2S packetloss of 5%.
The comprable S2C setting is
 
PacketLoss:S2CKickOutPercent

The third setting is

PacketLoss:SpectatorPercentAdjust

this is the percent to subtract from the
previously defined KickOutPercent's.

The fourth setting is simply

PacketLoss:PacketLossDisableWeapons

it is set to 0 or 1, on or off respectively.

(NOTE: I am not sure how high is "high" for the fourth setting, I
       can't piece together a reasonable guess for it.  The only 
       percent that we define is the kickout percent, but if it used
       that percent... would make no sense.)

Here are the PacketLoss settings in ASWZ Public arena:

PacketLoss:C2SKickOutPercent=920
PacketLoss:S2CKickOutPercent=920
PacketLoss:SpectatorPercentAdjust=500
PacketLoss:PacketLossDisableWeapons=1

This corresponds to a max C2S packetloss of 8% and a
max S2C packetloss of 8%.  In spectator mode you can
have 58% packetloss.  If you have "high" packetloss,
your weapons will be disabled.

Now that I've completed my summary of the two topics I
introduced at the beginning, let me add another description
to this.

The first addition is a setting which allows you to specify
a maximum latency before disabling a players weapons.  This
setting is

Latency:MaxLatencyForWeapons

The second addition is a setting which allows you to specify
a maximum latency time for prize packets before discarding them.
This setting is

Latency:MaxLatencyForPrizes

The third addition is a setting which allows you to specify a
maximum latency time before you are kicked out.  This setting is

Latency:MaxLatencyForKickOut

The fourth addition simply defines how long the
MaxLatencyForKickout must be exceeded before kicking.  This setting
is

Latency:LatencyKickOutTime


A fifth addition is a setting that allows you to specify a length
of time a user can receive no data from the server before disconnecting.
This setting is

Latency:S2CNoDataKickoutDelay

A sixth addition lets you define how much data to send per second before
cutting back on non-critical data.  This is important hardware has
physical limitations on how much data it can handle per second.  If this
threshold is surpassed, the person will suffer significant packetloss.

Latency:CutbackWatermark

The seventh and eigth settings are new, they allow you to define a 
max length of time during which no data can be received from a client,
if this max length of time is surpassed, an action is performed.
The seventh setting defines the length of time, it is

Latency:C2SNoDataTime

this setting is in 10ms, so 700 would correspond to 7000ms (7 seconds).

The eigth setting defines the actions to take when the time is surpassed,
it is 

Latency:C2SNoDataAction

this setting takes a value from 0 through 7.  The value consists of
adding the values of the actions to perform together:
1 - Display Sysop Warning
2 - Spec Player
4 - Kick Player
Add up the values of the events to perform, so if you wanted to display
the sysop warning and kick the player, you would add 1 and 4 to get 5, so
you would set Latency:C2SNoDataAction equal to 5.


In ASWZ pub, these settings have been set to

Latency:MaxLatencyForWeapons=175
Latency:MaxLatencyForPrizes=175
Latency:MaxLatencyForKickOut=175
Latency:LatencyKickOutTime=1200
Latency:S2CNoDataKickoutDelay=1000
Latency:CutbackWatermark=3500
Latency:C2SNoDataTime=200
Latency:C2SNoDataAction=3

To quickly translate:
If you take more than 175ms to send data, your weapons will be
disabled.  If you don't get a prize packet within 175ms
you won't ever get it.  If you take more than 175ms to send data consistently
for 1.2 seconds, you will be kicked.  If you receive no data from the server
for 1 second you will be kicked.  If you are in a crowded region or for some
other reason need to receive more than 3500 bytes of data per second, the
server will remove non-critical data from the send.  If you don't send any
data to the server for 2 seconds the sysop will receive a pretty red message
detailing your status as scum of the earth, and you will be sent to spec.

Whew... well there you have it, as I said earlier, this is how I pieced
together the doc with some help from other ops.  I will be keeping a close
eye on how the settings actually end up functioning and have no reluctance
to tweak them as needed.
