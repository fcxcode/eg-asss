notes on the game recording features:


the game recorder should be pretty simple. ?startrecord foo.game will
start recording the current arena to foo.game. ?stoprecord will stop it.
?playrecord foo.game will start playing it (and possibly lock everone in
spec for the duration of playback). it might support ?rewind, ?seek
+10 sec, etc.

update: the ?gamerecord command controls everything. seeking is too hard
and isn't currently working.

it works by recording "events" to a file, and then reading them and
faking them within the server for playback.

when it starts recording a game, it'll dump the list of everyone in the
arena to the file header, with their ships and freqs. then it will just
record events. what's an event?

enter arena (record pid, name, ship, freq)
leave arena (record pid, name)
ship change (record pid, ship)
freq change (record pid, freq)
kill (record killer, killed, bty, flags)
chat message (pub and team only) (record pid, type, optional freq, msg)
incoming position (the biggie) (record pid, position data)
(record ticks past start of game for all of them)

a special eof event at the end of the recorded game, maybe. (isn't
currently used.)


internal details:

how will it see all the events?
enter arena: playeraction cb
leave arena: playeraction cb
ship change: shipchange cb
freq change: freqchange cb
kill: kill cb
chat message: chat cb
incoming position: get raw position packets from net


how will it play back events?
enter arena: fake->CreateFakePlayer
leave arena: fake->EndFaked
ship change: game->SetFreqAndShip
freq change: game->SetFreq
kill: game->FakeKill
chat message: chat->SendAnyMessage
incoming position: game->FakePosition


how will it write events to a file?

it can do it synchronously, or pass them to a writer thread.

sychronously means it has to wait for file writes sometimes, and worse,
if we're using zlib, it has to compress them.

passing messages means it has to lock a mutex on every event, which is
fine for everything but ppks. well, it's probably fine for ppks too,
since they end up locking tons of outlistmtx's for each one.

update: async isn't so hard, and it's what's currently implemented. each
recorder gets a thread.


how will it read events and play them back?

it can have either a separate thread or a mainloop function.
update: a separate thread is created for each playing game.

game cleanup:
	kill all fake players that are part of the playback.
	send arena message.
	close file.
	deallocate structures.



file format:

update: see record.c



file size:

assume 20 playing players, so 200 position packets/second.
lots of spectators and team chat, so say 1 chat msg/second.
also 1 kill/second.

chat msg = 128+5*4 = 148 bts
kill = 6*4 = 24 bts
ppk = 32+3*4 = 44 bts

148+24+44*200 = 8972 bytes/second

assume zlib can get it down to 5k/second.

a one-hour game would take 5*3600k = 18000k = 18 megs
