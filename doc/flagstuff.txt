FlagMode
0 dropped are unowned, own all to win
1 dropped are owned, own all to win
2 turf-style

FlagResetDelay
time before unwon game is reset

MaxFlags
max flags in arena (0 to disable)

RandomFlags
0 actual number is max
1 actual number random, up to max

FlagReward
Formula = (playersInGame * playersInGame * FlagReward / 1000)

FlagRewardMode
How flag reward points are divided up (0 = each team member gets
rewardPoints) (1 = each team member gets (rewardPoints *
numberOfTeamMembers / maximumAllowedPerTeam))

FlagTerritoryRadius
When flagger drops flags, this is how spread out they are (distance
from drop-centroid in tiles)

FlagTerritoryRadiusCentroid
When flagger drops flags, this is how far the drop-centroid is randomly
adjusted from the actual drop location)

FriendlyTransfer
Whether the flaggers can transfer flags to other teammates


My settings:

GameType
FLAGGAME_NONE=0 no flag game
FLAGGAME_BASIC=1 the warzone-type game built in to the flags module
FLAGGAME_TURF=2 turf-style
FLAGGAME_CUSTOM=3 let other modules define the flag game

FlagResetDelay
time before unwon game is reset

FlagCount
number of flags in the arena. can be a range, as in "5-7". unused for
turf.

FlagSpawnCenterX
FlagSpawnCenterY
FlagSpawnRadius
where newly-spawned flags will appear

FlagDropRadius
how far from a drop the flag will appear

FriendlyTransfer
Whether the flaggers can transfer flags to other teammates


Flag reward points will be determined by separate modules. points_flag
will have it's own config settings:

FlagReward

quick guide to transition flag settings:

OLD SETTINGS TO KEEP
FlaggerOnRadar=1
FlaggerKillMultiplier=2
FlaggerGunUpgrade=1
FlaggerBombUpgrade=1
FlaggerFireCostPercent=1000
FlaggerDamagePercent=1000
FlaggerBombFireDelay=0
FlaggerSpeedAdjustment=0
FlaggerThrustAdjustment=0
CarryFlags=1                      make sure this agrees with GameType (see below)
FlagDropDelay=3000
FlagDropResetReward=0
EnterGameFlaggingDelay=1000
FlagBlankDelay=200
NoDataFlagDropDelay=500

OLD SETTINGS TO CHANGE
FlagMode=1                        get rid of this, there's a new way to specify game types
FlagResetDelay=1440000            rename to ResetDelay (not currently implemented)
MaxFlags=3                        change to FlagCount=3
RandomFlags=0                     get rid of this, use FlagCount=5-10
FlagReward=2500                   keep this
FlagRewardMode=0                  change name to SplitPoints
FlagTerritoryRadius=3             get rid of this, use DropRadius
FlagTerritoryRadiusCentroid=0     get rid of this, use DropRadius
FriendlyTransfer=0                keep this the same (not currently implemented)

NEW SETTINGS
GameType = FLAGGAME_BASIC
  options: FLAGGAME_NONE, FLAGGAME_BASIC, FLAGGAME_TURF, FLAGGAME_CUSTOM
  basic is warzone/running with movable flags. turf is turf (be sure to
  set CarryFlags=0, for now). custom means you have to load a module to
  define a new game. note that those constants are in
  settings/flaggames.h

SpawnX = 512
SpawnY = 512
SpawnRadius = 1024
  define where flags spawn and how far from that center

DropRadius = 2
  how far from a ship will flags drop

NeutRadius = 2
  how far from a ship will neuted flags appear

DropOwned = YES
  are dropped flags owned by the freq?

NeutOwned = NO
  are neuted flags owned by the freq? (obviously, YES prevents neuting)
