Hi. This is a development release of asss ("a small subspace server").
If you have any questions or comments, mail them to grelminar@yahoo.com.
The official home page of asss is http://asss.yi.org/.
The forum at http://forums.minegoboom.com/ (not run by me) is also a
helpful resource.

Most of the documentation is available in the user guide, in directory
"doc". You might want to read it before you try playing with this.

To start using this thing, make sure you're in the root directory of
this distribution (the directory that this file is in), and run
"bin/asss". You might want to run it in a screen session so it can be
detached easily. Or you can run "bin/asss -d" to make it fork into the
background.

You can close it with the sysop command ?shutdown, or just with a
Ctrl-C.

Note the presence of several empty directories: log, data, and tmp.
Don't remove any of them, the server needs them to be there to create
files in.


If you want to connect to a billing server, you can either use the
'billing_ssc' module or the 'billing' module with the proxy. The proxy
requires a relatively recent (2.1+) version of Python. The billing_ssc
module is somewhat better tested than the alternative.
