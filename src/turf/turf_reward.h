	 *
	 * Upon call to this function: 
	 * - The ta->teams linked list has a TurfTeam node for every team that
	 *   existed at any time during the past reward period.
	 * - The ta->validTeams linked list has a TurfTeam node for every team that 
	 *   passed the minimum requirements (conf settings).
	 * - The ta->players linked list already had a TurfPlayer node for every 
	 *   player that existed at any time during the past reward period.  A 
     *   player that played on more than one team will have separate nodes that
	 *   are linked to each team.  Every TurfPlayer node is guaranteed to be
	 *   linked to a TurfTeam node.
	 * - The ta->nonPlayers linked list contains nodes for all non-players.  A
	 *   non-player is:
	 *     1. someone marked as not playing (ex. entering arena)
	 *     2. someone in spectator mode (based on conf setting)
	 *     3. someone in a safe zone (based on conf setting)
	 * - Each team in ta->validTeams has
	 *     1. flags linked list of TurfFlags owned by the team
	 *     2. players linked list of TurfPlayers 'linked' to the team
	 *        Note: a TurfPlayer node is 'linked' if:
	 *          - player had played on the team at anytime during the previous
	 *            reward period
	 *          - team owns a flag that was tagged by that player
	 *     3. playersPts linked list of TurfPlayers that are playing
	 *     4. playersNoPts linkes list of TurfPlayers that are not playing
	 *        (same as ta->nonPlayers but for each team)
	 *
	 * To calculate, a normal scoring module will go through each team in 
	 * ta->validTeams and use the team->playersPts linked list to access
	 * each player's statistics.
	 *
	 * The module that registers this interface should fill in numPoints for 
	 * each team, each player, or both.  Obviously, to not award a team points, 
	 * set numPoints = 0.  By default, numPoints=0 for all players and teams. 
	 * The module has access to the arena's TurfArena data for the arena through 
	 * *ta.  There is no restriction on what can be altered within the TurfArena
	 * structure. Of course, bad data can be filled in, so use caution.
	 *
	 * The module that registers this interface should fill in the ta->calcState
	 * structure in order to tell turf_reward what to do after calling this
	 * function.
	 *
	 * The turf_reward lock for this arena is already in place upon call to this
	 * function.
