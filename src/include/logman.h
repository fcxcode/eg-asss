/* Ilogman - manages logging
 *
 * Log itself is used to add a line to the server log. it accepts
 * a variable number of parameters, so you can use it like printf and
 * save yourself a call to sprintf.
 *
 * log messages should be in the form:
 * "<module> {arena} [player] did something"
 * for easy filtering and searching through log files.
 * arena or player may be left out if not applicable.
 * if a player name is not available, "[pid=123]" should be used
 * instead.
