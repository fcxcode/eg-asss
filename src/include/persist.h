/*
 * Ipersist - score manager
 *
 * this manages all player scores (and other persistent data, if there
 * ever is any).
 *
 * it works like this: other modules register Player/ArenaPersistentData
 * descriptors with persist. key is a unique number that will identify
 * the type of data. length is the number of bytes you want to store, up
 * to CFG_MAX_PERSIST_LENGTH. scope describes where this data is valid,
 * and interval describes how many copies of it there are.
 *
 * when a player connects to the server, GetPlayer will be called which
 * will read that player's persistent information from the file and call
 * the SetData of all registered PlayerPersistentData descriptors.
 * PutPlayer will be called when a player is disconnecting, which will
 * call each data descriptor's GetData function to get the data to write
 * to the file. when switching arenas, the previous arena's data will be
 * synced to the file, and then the new arena's information synced from
 * it.
 *
 * a few things to keep in mind: the *PersistentData structure should
 * never change while the program is running. furthermore, the key,
 * length, scope, and interval fields should never change at all, even
 * across runs, or any previously created files will become useless. the
 * player will be locked before any of the Get/Set/ClearData functions
 * are called.
 *
 * StabilizeScores can be called with an integer argument to encure the
 * score files will be in a consistent state for that many seconds. This
 * can be used to perform backups while the server is running.
