/** @file
 * This file describes the Icapman interface, which is used by other
 * modules to check whether players can do various actions. It also
 * describes Igroupman, which is implemented by the default capability
 * manger, but might not always be available.
 *
 * Capabilities are named in the following way:
 *
 * If a player has the capabilty "cmd_<some command>", he can use that
 * command "untargetted" (that is, typed as a public message).
 *
 * If a player has the capability "privcmd_<some command>", he can use
 * that command directed at a player or freq (private or team messages).
 *
 * Other capabilites (e.g., "seeprivarenas") don't follow any special
 * naming convention.
 *
 * Note that some zones might want to use alternate implementations of
 * the capability manager interface, which might not have the concept of
 * groups at all, and thus won't support Igroupman. For almost all
 * purposes, you should use Icapman and not Igroupman, to reduce
 * dependence on the specific capman implementation present.
