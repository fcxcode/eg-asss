/** @file
 * configuration manager
 *
 * modules get all of their settings from here and nowhere else. there
 * are two types of configuration files: global and arena. global ones
 * apply to the whole zone, and are stored in the conf directory of the
 * zone directory. arena ones are usually stored in arenas/arenaname,
 * but this can be customized with the search path.
 *
 * the main global configuration file is maintained internally to this
 * moudule and you don't have to open or close it. just use GLOBAL as
 * your ConfigHandle. arena configuration files are also maintained for
 * you as arena->cfg. so typically you will only need to call GetStr and
 * GetInt.
 *
 * there can also be secondary global or arena config files, specified
 * with the second parameter of OpenConfigFile. these are used for staff
 * lists and a few other special things. in general, you should use a
 * new section in the global or arena config files rather than using a
 * different file.
 *
 * setting configuration values is relatively straightforward. the info
 * parameter to SetStr and SetInt should describe who initiated the
 * change and when. this information may be written back to the
 * configuration files.
 *
 * FlushDirtyValues and CheckModifiedFiles do what they say. there's no
 * need to call them in general; the config module performs those
 * actions internally based on timers also.
